# RoadSafetyPilotProject
Ranking intersections in the City of Montreal as part of a road safety pilot project. 

## Description 

You are a consultant hired by the City of Montreal as part of a road safety pilot project.
Faced with the constant increase in the number of accidents involving pedestrians on its
road network, the city decided to carry out a study to assess the level of risk at road
intersections. To do this, a sample of 1864 signalized intersections was selected (see
figure 1). This sample represents 80% of all signalized intersections on the island of
Montreal. For each intersection, the city has the total number of accidents involving
pedestrians and reported by the police (data from the SAAQ) in the last 10 years. In
addition, Department of Transportation engineers collected the following data:
- Traffic data on the average daily flows of pedestrians and vehicles at each intersection
- Geometry data (design) for each intersection including the number of lanes, types of
signals, layout for left turns, parking restrictions, etcâ€¦
- Road safety performance measures calculated by engineers for each intersection, based
on the number of potential daily interactions between pedestrians and vehicles,
depending on the directions and movements of the vehicles.
